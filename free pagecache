#script that allocated a ton of memory just to get rid of the cache.
To free pagecache:
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
To free dentries(directory entry) and inodes:
# echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
To free pagecache, dentries and inodes:
echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
This is a non-destructive operation in normal scenarios
and will only free things that are completely unused. Dirty objects will continue to be in use until written out to disk and are not freeable.
However it is always preferred to run "sync" first to flush useful things out to disk.
